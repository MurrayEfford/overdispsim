# Simulations of Overdispersion in SECR

An R package to perform and document simulations of spatially explicit capture--recapture in which activity centres are overdispersed.

The package may be installed in R using
```
devtools::install_github("MurrayEfford/overdispsim")
```

The vignette describes simulations reported in Efford and Fletcher (2024)
